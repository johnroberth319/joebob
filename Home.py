st.write("""
    JoeBob is a nickname I came up with as an alias for myself based on my actual name.
    With "Joe" being a reference to the first part of my first name "John" and 
         "Bob" being a reference to the second part of my first name "Robert," I came up with JoeBob, 
         a short and catchy name that is easy to remember.
