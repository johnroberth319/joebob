                # AI usage
                Claude AI helped a lot in generating code to calculate team scores and features. It did not include everything,
                So I spent a while going through and adjusting weights, fixing bugs, and adding comments. I do not know a lot
                about basketball, so having claude help seemed reasonable. Additionally, The output seems to actually make sense.
                Both ChatGPT and Claude were used in helping to create the pipeline and clean things up.

                # Project explanation

                ### This project uses basketball player data to build the most optimal team of 5 players using a neural network.
                ### Here are the steps involved:
                1. **Data Cleaning**: The raw player data is cleaned and filtered to keep relevant statistics. Only 100 players are picked.
                2. **Team Feature Generation**: Random teams are generated and their features are calculated. Picked from the 100 players.
                3. **Rules established**: There are rules made in order to determine what makes a good team.
                There are three categories that each have their own weights, and they are comprised of individual
                features that also have their own weights. The weights of the featres were determined by my general
                knowledge of basketball and trial and error. The weights of the categories were determined by trial
                and error.
                4. **Neural Network Training**: A neural network is built and trained to predict team quality scores based on the generated features.
                The neural network learns from the diffeerent combiations of teams and their scores.
                5. **Optimal Team Search**: The trained model is used to evaluate many possible 5-player combinations to find the best team, given the 100 players.
